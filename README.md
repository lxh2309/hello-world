**IMPORTANT**: In the project code, we use one and only one system verilog feature, that is passing a structure like ` reg [19:0] a [9:0]` to another module. If you want to compile the code, please make sure you enable Assignments -> Settings -> Verilog HDL input -> SystemVerilog. 

We use PS2 keyboard as input. To move the tetris, press $\leftarrow$
